## Introduction
This is my discord 'chatbot' project written in Python3.5 as part of a year 1 task using [Discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py).
Might continue working on it in the future.

## Features
* Roll a dice. Dices available: D4 / D6 / D8 / D10 / D100 / D12 / D20 / Dâˆž
* Have the bot tell a joke. It's funny, I promise.
* Music player.
* Looking for Group feature.
* A couple of dev commands.
* Ever changing 'Playing..' status.
* Some stuff are still WIP (duh)
