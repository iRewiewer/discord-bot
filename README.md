## Introduction
This is my discord chatbot project written in Python3 as part of the year 1 tasks using [Discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py).

## Features
* Roll a dice! Dices available: D4 / D6 / D8 / D10 / D100 / D12 / D20 / Dâˆž
* Have the bot tell a joke. It's funny, I promise!
* Image manipulation! Crop out a friend's profile picture over a chicken body!
* Music player. It's kind of mandatory in 2018, so here you go.
* Looking for Group feature. Automagically create temporary parties & voice channels for your favorite games.
* Ultra super secret dev commands! For admins with a good sense of humor.
* Natural Language interpreter! Talk casually with the bot and have it say totally unrelated things.
* Ever changing 'Playing..' status.
